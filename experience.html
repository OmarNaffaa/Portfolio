	<h2 class="sectionTitle"> Warehouse Management Systems Intern: Niagara Bottling </h2>
	<h3 class="dateLabel"> June 2019 - August 2019 </h3>
	
	<p>
		During the summer of 2019 I had the opportunity of interning at Niagara Bottling as a member of the Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) team
		within the IT department. The purpose of this team is to create and maintain the technology used in the bottling plants and	warehouses within
		the company. During the summer, interns at Niagara are given a primary project to complete along with other secondary projects that are done
		alongside the main project. In my case, my main project for the summer was to create a low-cost proof of concept self checkout system for truck
		drivers exiting the plant.
		<br><br>
		The way the current exit system is designed opens the warehouse exit gate automatically based on a proximity sensor, which lets trucks leave the
		company site without being accounted for. This, in turn, created a lot of logistic issues because more often than not truck drivers leave the
		facility without picking up their paperwork. To overcome these issues, my team and I created a system where a self checkout system would scan a
		QR code that is present on the paperwork the truck driver must pick up before leaving in order to open the gate, which ensures the truck driver
		leaves with all of their paperwork. The QR code on the paper will be generated at check in for a specific driver with a unique value, which will
		be sent a JSON payload using the REST API that will be used by the company to account for exiting truck drivers.

		<p>
			To keep costs low for our proof of concept, I elected to use a generic USB web-camera present within the company to scan the QR code and a
			<strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> as the central embedded system for the system, which cost less than $50 total. To ensure no unnecessary fees were incurred for
			this proof of concept, all the software features that were not programmed in-house were implemented using open source external libraries, which
			allowed us to develop the software for the system without having to pay extra fees.
			<br><br>
			<u>The software libraries used for this project include:</u>
			<br><br>
			<strong> OpenCV (C++) </strong>: <br>
			Computer Vision was utilized to allow an ordinary webcam to read and parse the QR code image that is captured by the program. Using this library
			along with generic camera hardware reduced the cost that comes with specialty equipment while allowing the application to utilize the internal
			webcam present in the ruggedized Windows tablet that would be used as the end product.
			<br><br>
			<strong> GTK+-3.0 (C/C++) </strong>: <br>
			This library was used to create a UI for the proejct using C/C++, which was needed since the computer vision code was written in C++. This library
			allowed the entire codebase to be written in C++, which greatly improved the performance of the system.
			<br><br>
			<strong> JSON-C / cURL (C++) </strong>: <br>
			These libraries were necessary to allow the application to communicate with the company server using REST API. Since C++ has no native protocols 
			to send JSON messages these libraries were required to implement a system to send information from the application to an external destination
			over the network.

		When creating the interface a lot of design constraints had to be accounted for. Since the project would be used on a screen with unknown dimensions it was important
		to create a responsive user interface that scales and adjusts to varying screens. GTK+-3.0 provides support for responsive design, and as a result the interface was configured
		to scale appropriately whether it was on a large monitor or a 7 inch Windows tablet. Another important consideration was making sure the interface is intuitve and easy to use 
		since truck drivers would be using the application at a relatively far distance. To solve this issue, the interface was designed with two large buttons with prominent icons that
		trigger the program functions and direct prompt that can be read quickly. Finally, an administrator section was added to allow an operator to configure the system for each plant 
		dynamically. Images of the interface are included below:

	<p>
		In addition to this project, I worked with my team to update Integ JNIOR (Java Network Input Output Resource) automation controllers to send a signal when a new pallet of water
		should be created. The system would communicate using the Modbus TCP/IP protocol to send information from the controller to a specified address. Updating the JNIORS in-house
		eliminated the time delay of requesting an update from the company while also reducing the cost of updating the software using an outside resource.
