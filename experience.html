			<p>
				Currently, I am a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Developer intern for the continuous improvement team within the supply chain department at Niagara Bottling, LLC. 
				By leveraging Automation Anywhere and Excel VBA I am able to remove tedious and manually intensive tasks from the workflow of supply chain team members at the company,
				automating processes ranging from scheduling 40+ purchase orders a day to automating the end-to-end process of requesting business reports from the company server.
				<br><br>
				Within this role I was able to utilize my project management abilities to complete automation bots requested by department team members by owning the process from 
				beginning to end; this includes gathering bot requirements, developing the bot and accompanying Excel macros, testing, deployment, and documentation. Additionally,
				I am responsible for performing routine maintenance on bots I have deployed in order to ensure proper operation during run-time.
				<br><br>
				In total, I have fully developed 6 bots that save the department approximately 4 hours of a team member's labor per day.

		<p>
			At Niagara Bottling I served as a Systems Engineering intern for the Digitalization team within Niagara Bottling, LLC. The main purpose of this role
			is to utilize the Ignition Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) platform to visualize data collected from PLCs within the
			plants throughout the company and create high performance, responsive Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) to aid various departments within
			the company.
			During this past summer, I was given 2 primary projects to work on along with many day-to-day tasks. My primary projects include a User Interface (UI) to automate 
			the setup of Ignition Gateways as well as a User Management UI to manage accounts linked to the gateway remotely.

				Outside of my projects I have had the opportunity to learn and apply continuous improvement strategies during both years of my internship with 
				Niagara.
				<br><br>
				My previous year as an intern at Niagara I was able to acquire my Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt by completing the training courses provided by the 
				company. Using the knowledge I acquired from this training, I kept streamlining and optimization in mind when designing solutions for my projects.
				The Gateway Automation and User Management UI have both been creating to improve on the process of working with Ignition within Niagara by saving 
				time that would go into tedious tasks. In particular, letting team managers control the access level of their employees within Ignition will 
				significantly improve the workflow of Ignition-reliant teams within the company.

		<h2 class="sectionTitle"> Warehouse Management Systems Intern: Niagara Bottling </h2>
		
		<p>
			During the summer of 2019 I had the opportunity of interning at Niagara Bottling as a member of the Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) team
			within the IT department. The purpose of this team is to create and maintain the technology used in the bottling plants and	warehouses within
			the company. During the summer, interns at Niagara are given a primary project to complete along with other secondary projects that are done
			alongside the main project. In my case, my main project for the summer was to create a low-cost proof of concept self checkout system for truck
			drivers exiting the plant.
			<br><br>
			The way the current exit system is designed opens the warehouse exit gate automatically based on a proximity sensor, which lets trucks leave the
			company site without being accounted for. This, in turn, created a lot of logistic issues because more often than not truck drivers leave the
			facility without picking up their paperwork. To overcome these issues, my team and I created a system where a self checkout system would scan a
			QR code that is present on the paperwork the truck driver must pick up before leaving in order to open the gate, which ensures the truck driver
			leaves with all of their paperwork. The QR code on the paper will be generated at check in for a specific driver with a unique value, which will
			be sent a JSON payload using the REST API that will be used by the company to account for exiting truck drivers. The resulting prototyped interface
			is pictured below.
